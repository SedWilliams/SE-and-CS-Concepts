# What is this repo?
This is a project I've started to store code snippets that I have built for the purpose of furthering my own understanding. I do hope other people can learn from the posted code as a byproduct though. Here you may find various well documented code snippets demonstrating and applying __computer science__ and __software engineering__ topics from __DSA and Algorithms__, to more theoretical __principles and concepts__.

# Where can I find more on these topics?
I plan on uploading various CS and SE related videos on my youtube channel (@Shedrick Williams). But there are many many other great resources for the same topics as well. If it's not on my channel I would probably go find a book or the official documentation to read up on it.
